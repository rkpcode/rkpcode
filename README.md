## 👨‍💻 Professional Philosophy
* **Production-First Mindset:** I don't just train models; I build reproducible pipelines using **DVC** for data versioning and **MLflow** for experiment tracking.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** AI should not be a "black box." I leverage **SHAP** to ensure regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust, especially in high-stakes industries like Fintech.
* **Systems Thinking:** My background in Civil Engineering provides a foundation in precision-based management, while my Master's in Mass Media allows me to apply behavioral insights to churn and NLP tasks.

## 📂 Featured Production Projects

### 🛡️ [Loan Default Guard](https://github.com/rkpcode/loan_defult_prediction_system)
* **Problem:** High credit risk and lack of transparency in automated loan rejections.
* **Solution:** Developed a classification system achieving **95%+ Recall** to minimize financial exposure.
* **Tech:** `XGBoost`, `SHAP` (for auditability), `Streamlit`.
* **Impact:** Enabled auditable risk assessment, providing clear "reasons for rejection" for regulatory compliance.

### 📊 [Retail Margin Intel](https://github.com/rkpcode/Retail_Sales_Intelligence_System)
* **Problem:** Manual audits for margin erosion were labor-intensive (15+ hours/week).
* **Solution:** Built an anomaly detection engine with **85.2% Precision** to identify margin leaks.
* **Tech:** `XGBoost`, `SMOTE` (imbalance handling), `FastAPI`.
* **Impact:** Automated the audit process, significantly reducing manual overhead and operational costs.

### 🏗️ [Industrial Steel QA](https://github.com/rkpcode/ML_projects)
* **Problem:** Slow and inconsistent manual inspection of steel surfaces in manufacturing.
* **Solution:** Engineered a **U-Net** segmentation model for pixel-level defect detection.
* **Tech:** `PyTorch`, `Computer Vision`, `Docker`.
* **Impact:** Provided a scalable blueprint for automated quality control in heavy industry.
